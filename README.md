# Project Boost


Welcome to Project Boost, a platformer I am creating for the Udemy course I am doing- "The Complete C# Developer 3D(by Ben Tristem and Rick Davidson, GameDev.tv). The goal of the game is to reach the green landing pad. You maneuver your starship from a launch pad to a landing pad, dodging the obstacles on the way. Some of the obstacles may move, depending on the level.
