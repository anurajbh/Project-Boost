# Project Boost


Welcome to Project Boost, a platformer I am creating for the Udemy course I am doing- "The Complete C# Developer 3D(by Ben Tristem and Rick Davidson, GameDev.tv). The goal of the game is to reach the green landing pad. You maneuver your starship from a launch pad to a landing pad, dodging the obstacles on the way. Some of the obstacles may be moving. Each level is more difficult than the previous. 

Credits for the sound assets and particle effects go to Limit-Snap Creations and Ben Tristem and Rick Davidson.
